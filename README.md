Recommender Systems Algorithms on different datasets

1) Collaborative Filtering for users based on Movies and Rating data: Matches a user with other users with similar interests(similar users) and gives movie recommendations to the user based on what those similar users rated/liked (movie rating). The intuition being users with similar interests are likely to watch the same movie if it recommmended.
2) Content Based Filtering for users based on movie Metadata: based on movie overview/plot as the deciding factor(content) recommending similar movies to the users. The intuition being if a user liked a particular movie or show, she/he might like a movie or a show similar to it.
